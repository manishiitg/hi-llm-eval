                      None of the statements necessarily follow directly from the given statements.
 
Here's why:
 
"Those who like running like flowers." This is not necessarily true. We know from statement II that those who like running like music, but this does not imply that they like flowers.
 
"Those who like paintings like music." This is not necessarily true. We know from statement I that those who like paintings like flowers, but this does not imply that they like music.
 
"Those who like flowers do not like running." This is not necessarily true. Statement II and III do not establish a relationship between liking flowers and not liking running.
 
"Those who like running do not like paintings." This is not necessarily true. None of the original statements make any claim about a relationship between liking running and disliking paintings.
 
"Those who like paintings like running." This is not necessarily true. Statement I and II do not establish a relationship between liking paintings and liking running.
 
Remember, in logic, you cannot make assumptions beyond what is given in the premises.

**english_answer**
                      For a moist sponge cake, the key is not to overmix the batter once the flour is added, as it can toughen the cake. Using room temperature ingredients helps for even mixing. Baking at a moderate temperature, like 350°F (175°C), and checking for doneness towards the end of baking is crucial. The cake should spring back when lightly touched and a skewer inserted in the center should come out clean.

                      A group of four friends are going to play a board game together. They have to choose between four games: chess, checkers, monopoly, and scrabble. Each friend has a different preference for the game. Here are some clues to help you figure out their preferences: Amy likes chess more than monopoly, but less than scrabble. Bob likes checkers more than chess, but less than monopoly. Carol likes scrabble more than checkers, but less than chess. Dan likes monopoly more than scrabble, but less than checkers. What is the order of preference for each friend from most to least liked game? Write your answer using the following format: Friend: Game > Game > Game > Game


**answer_english**
                      Let's figure this out based on the preferences provided:
 
Amy likes chess more than monopoly, but less than scrabble.
So, the order for Amy: Scrabble > Chess > Monopoly. We're not told Amy's opinion on Checkers, so we'll assume it's her least favorite game.
 
Bob likes checkers more than chess, but less than monopoly.
So, the order for Bob: Monopoly > Checkers > Chess. We're not told Bob's opinion on Scrabble, so we'll assume it's his least favorite game.
 
Carol likes scrabble more than checkers, but less than chess.
So, the order for Carol: Chess > Scrabble > Checkers. We're not told Carol's opinion on Monopoly, so we'll assume it's her least favorite game.
 
Dan likes monopoly more than scrabble, but less than checkers.
So, the order for Dan: Checkers > Monopoly > Scrabble. We're not told Dan's opinion on Chess, so we'll assume it's his least favorite game.
 
So here's the final preference order for each friend:
 
Amy: Scrabble > Chess > Monopoly > Checkers
Bob: Monopoly > Checkers > Chess > Scrabble
Carol: Chess > Scrabble > Checkers > Monopoly
Dan: Checkers > Monopoly > Scrabble > Chess
